      <h1><li>What are the different parts of a CSS style rule?</h1>
        <h2>A CSS style rule is comprised of the selector, the property, and the value to be assigned to that property.</h2>
      </li>
     <h1> <li> What are an element selector and grouped element selector in CSS? Provide an example of each.</h1>
        <h2>Element selectors are based on the name of the element. For example, using the body selector to effect all the elements within the body tag.<br>
          A grouped element selector uses multiple elements in order to change the properties of each of the elements in the same way, to save the programmer from having to repeat the code multiple times.
    </h2>
      </li>
      <h1><li>What are class selectors in CSS? What are id selectors in CSS?</h1>
        <h2>Class selectors are used to group multiple elements that have been assigned a particular class attribute using "class =" in their tags. ID selectors are used to select one particular element and affect the properties under just that tag.<br><br> For example, using an "id=redlink" and then using the #redlink selector to make just that hyperlink red.</h2>
      </li>
     <h1> <li> What are contextual selectors in CSS?</h1>
        <h2>Contextual selectors allow programmers to select a specific sub-tag within another tag, also referred to as a "descendent" of that tag. Instead of using a comma like in a grouping selector, you string the two selectors together with a space between them with the "anscestor" first and the "descendent" second.</h2>
      </li>
      <h1><li>What are the three cascade principles used by browsers when style rules conflict?</h1>
        <h2>When style rules conflict, the browser will sort them in the following order:
          <ul><li>Origin. The author's style sheets have precendence over the reader's.</li>
            <li>Specificity. A more specific selector will override a more general one. For example, an id selector will override the same property set in an element selector.</li>
            <li>Order. If everything else is the same, the one that is specified further down in the style sheet will override the other.</li>
          </ul>
            </h2>
<p>Note: <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WD-CSS2-971104/cascade.html#didx-cascade">The W3C CSS2 Specification</a> was used and paraphrased for the response to question 5. </p>
